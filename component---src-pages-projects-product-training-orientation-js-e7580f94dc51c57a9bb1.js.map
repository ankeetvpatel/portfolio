However, a key step\r\n              before the launch was to ensure that all the in-house and external\r\n              agents were abreast with the new product.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              The currently available training material was found to less\r\n              effective as almost 40% of agents were unable to clear the post\r\n              product training assessment. The Sales Manager contacted me to\r\n              analyze the training material. The manager, who was also the\r\n              Subject Matter Expert (SME), and I agreed that there were three\r\n              key pitfalls in the training material.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              One: the material was overloaded with unnecessary details that the\r\n              agents on the ground would never need. Two: the training was\r\n              filled with key financial information but was devoid of context or\r\n              real-world scenarios for learners. Three: the training only\r\n              focused on 'knowing' but not much on the 'doing' part of learning.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure class='container mx-auto mb-10 flex w-5/6 flex-col items-center'>\r\n              <StaticImage\r\n                class='mb-1 rounded object-cover object-center'\r\n                alt='Product Training Navigation Menu'\r\n                src='../../images/projects/product-training-orientation/03-Navigation Menu.jpg'\r\n              />\r\n              <figcaption class='text-xs sm:text-sm'>\r\n                Product Training Navigation Menu\r\n              </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              To address the above, I proposed an eLearning-based product\r\n              training with a locked linear navigation where the next module\r\n              only unlocks after the previous one has been completed. This\r\n              progressive style of learning ensures that the learners would\r\n              first uncover basic information related to the financial loan\r\n              product, before they explore the key processes to apply for the\r\n              loan. Once they are through the first two modules, they would then\r\n              be exposed to common customer scenarios, where they get to make\r\n              key decisions related to serving the loan applicants.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2 class='title-font mb-4 text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-slate-400 sm:text-3xl'>\r\n              Process\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              I worked closely with the SME to ideate on, design and develop\r\n              this interactive eLearning product orientation.

The original\r\n              training documents combined with key insights from the SME served\r\n              as input for this exercise. After long deliberations and\r\n              discussions, it was decided that the content should move the\r\n              learner progressively from 'learning' about the home improvement\r\n              loan to 'doing' - in other words, making key decisions pertaining\r\n              to the customers' queries about this product.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure class='container mx-auto mb-10 flex w-5/6 flex-col items-center'>\r\n              <StaticImage\r\n                class='mb-1 rounded object-cover object-center'\r\n                alt='Locked Navigation Menu Ensures Progressive Learning'\r\n                src='../../images/projects/product-training-orientation/04-Locked Navigation.jpg'\r\n              />\r\n              <figcaption class='text-xs sm:text-sm'>\r\n                Locked Navigation Menu Ensures Progressive Learning\r\n              </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <h3 class='title-font mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-400 sm:text-2xl'>\r\n              Rapid Prototyping\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              Once the higher-level content flow was approved, it was agreed\r\n              that we should initiate rapid prototyping for each module. Most\r\n              importantly, I had to make sure that the client gets clarity on\r\n              the functionality and interactivity available to the learners.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              This allowed us the flexibility to make changes, if any, before a\r\n              full-blown package was developed in Articulate Storyline with all\r\n              the bells and whistles.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <figure class='container mx-auto mb-10 flex w-5/6 flex-col items-center'>\r\n              <StaticImage\r\n                class='mb-1 rounded object-cover object-center'\r\n                alt='Rapid Prototyping of Most Common Layouts'\r\n                src='../../images/projects/product-training-orientation/05-Rapid Prototyping of Common Slide Layouts.jpg'\r\n              />\r\n              <figcaption class='text-xs sm:text-sm'>\r\n                Rapid Prototyping of Most Common Layouts\r\n              </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n            <h3 class='title-font mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-400 sm:text-2xl'>\r\n              Developing the eLearning Package in Storyline\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p class='mb-8 leading-relaxed'>\r\n              Once the storyboard was approved, the content was in place.
